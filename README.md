### Rules for using GitHub

1. Create a new branch name that will be branched from the develop branch. If it is a new feature, put feature/sample (do not name it after an individual), if it is a bug of that feature, put feature/level2/level3.
2. After completing the task, you need to create a pull request (PR) to the develop branch (avoid merging into the develop branch).
3. Because the system will set up CI/CD, whoever merges the system will auto-deploy. Git is free so there is no limit to where members can merge themselves into develop.
